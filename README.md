https://laith8910.github.io/company-home-page/

## Techniques Used
In order to make the site reactive I primarily used a pair of techniques designed around the visual breakpoints of the site, utilising CSS media queries and flexboxes.

## Project Status
**This project is complete!**
If I were to spend more time on this project I would create seperate CSS stylesheets for desktop and mobile to create a better visual layout when viewing the site on a desktop.
